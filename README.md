# Optimized-Emergency-Response-System

In a sprawling city, every second counts when an emergency call comes in. 
The challenge for any emergency response service is to cut through the chaos, manage limited resources like hospital beds and ambulances, and make life-saving decisions instantly. This project tells the story of building an intelligent system designed to tackle this very problem, using a series of powerful algorithms to bring order and efficiency to emergency response.
